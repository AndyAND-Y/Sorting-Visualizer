const selectionSortText = `Selection sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm characterized by its in-place nature and quadratic time complexity. The algorithm iteratively divides the input array into two subarrays: the sorted portion and the unsorted portion. During each iteration, the algorithm identifies the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted subarray through a linear scan, utilizing a series of pairwise comparisons. Subsequently, the located minimum element is exchanged with the first element of the unsorted subarray, incrementally expanding the sorted subarray's boundary. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted. Despite its simplicity, selection sort's performance is limited by its O(n^2) time complexity, rendering it inefficient for large datasets due to its excessive number of comparisons and exchanges.`
