Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through a list of elements, 
compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. During each pass 
through the list, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position. While 
conceptually easy to understand, Bubble Sort is not very efficient for large datasets due 
to its average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). More efficient sorting algorithms 
like Quick Sort and Merge Sort are often preferred for larger datasets. O(1) O(n) O(nlgn)
